custom discord.py bot

This bot is just a fun project I work on from time to time and will most likely have errors.

If you would like to try the bot and see it in action, come to https://discord.gg/DCwX432tdE
See you there!


This bot has music commands ran by Lavalink, you will need to set this up locally to be able to use the commands in discord.
I will add a useful .bat file that can run the commands to start it for you once it has been setup (will probably also need to be changed)
